## Details

I'm very proud of what this project was able to achieve but to say the least, it was my biggest project so far. so as you
expect, it was quite a pain to deal with.


### What did I learn

- How to abstract the API, and the main implementation to its own dedicated module.
- How to use the Guice Framework (in an unfinished 2nd rewrite of the project).


### My mistakes

- Ensure each object is charge of... itself...
